Welcome to Artistic Style/2!

Precompiled binary is under .\os2.bin subdirectory.

Port was done with Visual Age C++ 4.0+p1.
Well, I just compiled it withouth any problem, no patches were required.
To compile it again all you need in astyle.icc:

[c:\astyle]vacbld astyle.icc

Thats all.

Comments and suggestions to OS/2 port are welcome.
